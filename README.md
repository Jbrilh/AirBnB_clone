# Command Interpreter Readme

## Overview

The command interpreter is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with a system or application through a command-line interface (CLI). This document provides a brief guide on how to start the interpreter, how to use it, and includes examples to help users get started quickly.

## How to Start

1. **Installation:**
   Ensure that the command interpreter is installed on your system. If not, follow the installation instructions provided in the official documentation.

2. **Launch the Interpreter:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and type the command to launch the interpreter.

   ```bash
   $ command_interpreter
   ```

   Replace `command_interpreter` with the actual command or executable name.

## How to Use

The command interpreter follows a syntax where commands and arguments are entered in a specific format. Here are some basic usage guidelines:

1. **Command Format:**
   Commands are typically entered in the following format:

   ```bash
   $ command_name [option1] [option2] ... [arguments]
   ```

2. **Options:**
   Options modify the behavior of a command. They are prefixed with a hyphen or double hyphen.

   ```bash
   $ command_name -o
   $ command_name --option
   ```

3. **Arguments:**
   Arguments are values passed to a command to perform specific actions.

   ```bash
   $ command_name arg1 arg2
   ```

4. **Help:**
   Access the built-in help to get information about commands and their usage.

   ```bash
   $ command_name --help
   ```

## Examples
